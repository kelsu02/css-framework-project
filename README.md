# CSS Framework Project

The challenge is to create a website using components from a CSS Framework. The componenets you need to include are in the index.html. Content can be generic, the main goal is to get you comfortable with finding and implementing CSS Frameworks. I will do a code review with each of you after you push up your `develop-<your-name-here>` branch to my repository: https://github.com/kelsu02/css-framework-project.git

If you need images Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/) is free for commercial/private/any use. File sizes are large so click on the image in that pop up that comes up click the arrow next to download free and take the small image. Otherwise you may need to run them through an image compressor to be able to push up your project to GitHub if your internet connection is not great.

## GIT Flow

### Initial Setup

1. In your GitHub account create a new project css-framework-project
2. In your terminal cd into your projects (or what your name is) folder
3. Clone down the repository: `git clone https://github.com/kelsu02/css-framework-project.git`
    - If you are on a Mac you might need to clone down with the SSH key instead of the Https
    - This sets up the origin remote
        - To push to this remote: `git push origin`
4. cd into css-framework-project
5. Checkout a develop branch with your name: `git checkout -b develop-<your-name-here>`
    - This command creates a new branch and puts you on it. It's the equivalent of `git
6. Set up your mygh remote (to your repository): `git remote add mygh https://github.com/<your-user-name>/css-framework-project`
    - Same thing here about the SSH key instead of the Https
    - To push to this remote: `git push mygh`

### Updating the CSS

1. Open up the project in VSCode
    - if you are coming from your terminal type `code .` while you are in that project and it should open up.
2. In the index.html add the cdn for bootstrap above the call for the CSS stylesheet.
    - Use the one appropriate for your framework.
3. Implement the components (some may be obvious others you may have to search for)

### Submitting your solution

1. After you have a solution commit your changes
    - `git status`
        - You can git status at any time to see what files are staged for your commit and to see which ones have been changed but aren't included in this commit
    - `git add .` or `git add <filename>` 
        - 2nd option if you have made changes in unrelated files and you don't want to include them in this commit
    - `git commit -m "Message about your solution"`
        - The message should be descriptive to tell others what you accomplished.
2. Push your changes to the Origin repository
    - FIRST PUSH: `git push --set-upstream origin develop-<your-name>`
    - `git push origin`
        - You should see this remote information: To https://github.com/kelsu02/css-framework-project.git
        - To check remote `git remote -v`
3. Push your changes to your own repository (if you want to keep a copy)
    - FIRST PUSH: `git push --set-upstream mygh develop-<your-name>`
    - `git push mygh`
        - You should see this remote information: To https://github.com/<your-github-username\>/css-framework-project.git
        - to check remote `git remote -v`

If you push to your own repository you can practice doing pull requests to your main branch and see the process from start to finish. Doing pull requests to your repository from your develop to your main will give you github activity.
